Simulation mode: Analysis of an alpha particle beam

### Inputs about the alpha particles ###
Initial kinetic energy = 0.01 MeV
Initial number of alpha particles = 20
Probability density function used for random number generation: Python 3's basic distribution, where random numbers between 0 and 1 were randomly generated, and where 0 but not 1 were included in the set of numbers that could have been generated
Seed for the random number generators = 0

### Inputs about the medium ###
Atomic number = 1
Atomic weight = 1 g/mol
Mass density = 1 g/cm^3

### Inputs about the simulation ###
Number of simulation instances: 6
